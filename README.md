# My Movie Project

This is the latest version of my movie project using an object oriented programming approach in python. 
Users can create their own movie storage, add movies by title, get stats on the ratings, sort the movies, 
search for a specific movie and more. The project uses a movie API to add movies to each user's personal
storage, either json or csv. The user can choose to generate a website showing his or her collection of
movies. This is done using flask.

## Installation

To install this project, simply clone my repository and install the dependencies.

## Usage

To use this project, run the following command - `python main.py`.
